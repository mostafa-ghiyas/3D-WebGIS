# 3D-WebGIS
Visual displays of urban development projects are powerful tools that help executive teams with key strategic decisions. The ability to view three-dimensional images of the surface and buildings from different view point, without having to be physically present at the location, is one of the main capabilities of this system. This is possible through the creation of a three-dimensional model of the city as well as panoramic images (360 Â°) of the features.
